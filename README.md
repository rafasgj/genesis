Genesis Game Design Engine
==========================

`Genesis` is a tool designed to aid in teaching game design. It is not a
full fledged game engine (not even for 2D games). It is not a library
to develop games. It does not even make it easier to create games. If
you want to develop your own games, you should be using [Godot],
[pygame] or [Ogre].

The focus of `Genesis` in on creating a platform where 2D games can be 
created, with minimal to none programming logic, so that students
starting to learn game programming, or game design, can create games
based on the description of objects and events.
